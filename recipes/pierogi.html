    <p>Pierogi is a polish dumpling, typically filled with potatoes and sauerkraut. But these little dumplings can be filled with anything you like!</p>
    <p>Some little twists can include cheese or ground sausage.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Sauerkraut</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups sauerkraut, drained and minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Potato Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon salt</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</li>
        <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li> 
    </ol>

    <p>After boiling, you can fry the pierogis in butter alongside some onion slices until golden.  Top with bacon bits and dip in sour cream!</p>
